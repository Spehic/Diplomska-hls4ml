# Enviroment

I recommend running this on Ubuntu 20.04

Running the tutorials requires Vivado 2020.1 to be installed. After the installation, the necessary environmental variables can be set using.

source /path/to/your/installtion/Xilinx/Vivado/2020.1/settings64.(c)sh

The Python environment used for the tutorials is specified in the environment.yml file. It can be setup like:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate Diplomska-hls4ml
source /path/to/your/installtion/Xilinx/Vivado/2020.1/settings64.(c)sh
